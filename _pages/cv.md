Experience
======
Sept 2023 - Present: Atmospheric Sciences Ph.D. Student | University of Washington
My research uses machine learning to quantify internal variability and predict sea ice concentration due to accelerated polar warming, known as Arctic Amplification (AA). Many climate models are unable to emulate the same rate of warming that is observed in the poles, so my research goal is to unveil the contribution to AA from the inherent variability of the climate system for each season. Following this work, I will investigate future projections of sea ice concentrations constrained by internal variability. I am advisd by Professor Qiang Fu.
